# setup folder and Project Content

## Whether you start by using a boilerplate or from scratch, here we start adding to the the new project.

> edit the title

```html
<title>Natours | Exciting tours for adventurous people</title>
```

> Create and add all the images to the images folder

- Using the design as a guide make a list of the images with different sizes and crops

- then, using the guide and template, create all the images in the list and transfer them into the project's images folder

> add all icons and illustrations to the icons folder using svg format directly from the design in figma

`keep `all original media` in a separate folder to be able to generate new sizes when needed`

> add initial variables to variables.scss

using the design as a guide identify and create some variables for colors, examples:

```scss
$mainBlue: #2f5572; // $primaryColor
$mainOrange: #d59541; // $secondaryColor

$mainWhite: #fafafa;
$mainDarkGray: #4d4d4d;
```

_step 1 `delete dummy code from tests`._

> select everything in this file (All of this was just dummy or test code from our Web pack And post CSS lesson.) `and delete it`

> also delete any test in index.html (`h1`)
